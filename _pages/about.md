Welcome to my personal website! I am a postdoctoral associate at the [K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/) at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/). I believe that understanding the processes that drive patterns in biodiversity is the key to effectively managing and conserving it. Biodiversity is a complex concept that includes the diversity of species, but also their ecological functions and evolutionary histories, and I focus on multiple dimensions of biodiversity in my research. In doing so, I often couple large, publicly available datasets on species, their traits, and their evolutionary histories with satellite remote sensing data to understand and model biodiversity patterns.

I started my PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2020 with Ben Zuckerberg and Jonathan Pauli. During my PhD I coupled newly developed, remote sensing products on [seasonal snow cover dynamics](10.1016/j.rse.2021.112309) with data on bird occurrence and abundance from project [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) to examine the role that [snow cover plays in species winter distributions](10.1111/ecog.06378). I then extended this work for cold-adapted birds and mammals to model the distribution of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of cold-adapted species across the United States for spatial conservation planning objectives. While snow cover is a defining feature of temperate, polar, and high-elevation regions, seasonality is a ubiquitous feature of all ecosystems. While seasonality is often examined as a major agent structuring patterns of biodiversity, it is often difficult to study seasonally-induced diversity dynamics. Thus, during my PhD I explored how [bird assemblages and their functional traits change in response seasonal shifts in productivity and climate across North America](10.1111/ele.14521).

As a postdoc at the Yang Center, I am working with [Connor Wood](https://connormwood.com/) to investigate the drivers of biodiversity across the Sierra Nevada mountains in central California using bioacoustics. We are interested in the relative role that topographic, climatic, habitat, and fire gradients play in driving avian assemblage composition, or beta-diversity, across the Sierra. Furthermore, we have ongoing projects to link climate change and management practices across the Sierra Nevada to biodiversity outcomes in an age of rapid ecological change.
