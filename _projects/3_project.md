Diversity is seldom static in space and time. While much work has been done on the potential drivers of species diversity across space we lack corrollary information on the dynamics of diversity across seasonal scales. However, seasonal shifts in climate and resource availability can resemble large-scale changes in these conditions across vast geographic distances. A third major theme of my work is to explore the patterns and responses of biodiversity to seasonality. Using seasonally dynamic measures of climate and productivity across North America I am interested in understanding how diversity changes
