# This page is a work in progress...more coming soon!

The sheer amount of species on this planet is one of the most remarkable aspects of life on Earth and biodiversity is critical for sustaining a future on this planet. Whether it be the insects that pollinate commercially important crops or the birds that maintain the diversity of tropical forests, we live in an interconnected world. The globalization and industrialization of human society has ushered in a new geological epoch, the anthropocene. A signature of the anthropocene, is that our footprint overlaps more and more with the natural systems around us. Whether it be human-driven climate change, agricultural intensification, pollution, or harvesting pressure species are facing a diverse set of threats. A major theme of my research program is understanding how changing environments ultimately drive changes in animal communities. To answer this broad question, I integrate data from participatory science projects, satellite remote sensing products, and large-scale wildlife monitoring projects to assess how multiple aspects of biodiversity change over both space and time.
