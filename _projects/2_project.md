# This page is a work in progress...more coming soon!

Winter in temperate, polar, and high-elevation ecosystems across the global is an energetically taxing period of the annual cycle. Winter is also one of the fastest changing times of the year. Contemporary changes in climate have led to the widespread modification of the cryosphere, such as seasonal snow cover in temperate ecosystems. Despite what meets the eye, snow cover provides habitat for a variety of organisms but it is rarely studied. A second major theme of my research is investigating how contemporary and future winter climate, paritcularly seasonal snow cover, shapes species distributions and demography.

## The role of snow cover in winter bird distributions
